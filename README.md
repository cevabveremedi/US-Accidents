## Project Report

This project analyzes the 'US Accidents (2016 - 2023)' dataset for an imaginary insurance company. The goal was to identify patterns in traffic accidents and find ways to reduce them, ultimately lowering insurance payouts. The project involves data analysis, visualization, and a detailed report on accident trends and prevention strategies. Unfortunately, the report was written in Turkish; however, to grasp the general idea and look at the generated graphs, you can find the full report below.
